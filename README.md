- 👋 Hi, my name is Mike
- 👀 Currently, I am interested in the production of small things of mass demand, the production of which I want to launch.
- 🌱 At the moment, I am mastering a machine for laser cutting and engraving. There are also plans to purchase a lathe, milling, drilling and sawing machines, as well as a 3D printer and all related devices and equipment for the above machines. 
- 💞️ I am looking for partners who make small blanks of metal and wood, in the form of plates, with a maximum size of 25×25 centimeters.
